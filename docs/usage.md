# Usage

### Status-bar chip

- Compact chip with your **lowest remaining quota**, or every provider side by
  side (`Status bar mode`).
- Hover for the full breakdown: **every provider and every window** (Session,
  Spark 5h, Spark Weekly…) with `% left` and time-to-reset.

### Quota pane

Reachable three ways: the **docked pane** (`Placement: right`, 300px, toggled in
Settings), the **`/quota` route** and the **sidebar nav row** (`Quota`, pulse
icon).

- One card per provider with the official brand icon, a tonal progress bar, the
  plan badge and per-window rows.
- Detail lines where the API offers them: credits, banked resets, extra limits.
- Providers without data collapse into a quiet **"No data (n)"** section — the
  default view shows only providers with live numbers.
- **Pane detail**: `clean` (percentage windows and balance headlines) or `dense`
  (every window, reset time and detail line). Dense is the default.
- Footer: `Checked Jan 15, 2025, 12:34:56 PM UTC · 46s old · poll 60s`,
  localized with the full date, seconds and timezone. Provider cards scroll
  separately so long balance details cannot overlap the footer.
- Notices when something is off: an **update available** banner (checked against
  the installed build) and a **version-skew** notice when the widget and the
  backend are not the same build.

### Settings

Everything lives in the pane's **Quota Settings** view and persists locally:

| Setting | Values | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Status bar mode | `all providers` · `worst only` | `all providers` |
| Show status bar indicator | on · off (the Hermes status bar must also be visible: ⌘K → Toggle status bar) | on |
| Pane detail | `clean` — just the percentage bars · `dense` — windows, resets and detail lines | `dense` |
| Reset format | `relative` (`2h 15m (14:30)`) · `absolute` (`14:30`) | `relative` |
| Refresh interval | 15–600 s | `600` |
| Enabled providers | toggle any provider on/off (cherry-pick) | all on |
| Show docked quota pane | on · off | on |

### Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/quota` | Show the current table in chat (refreshes first if stale) |
| `hermes quota` | Same as `hermes quota status` |
| `hermes quota status` | Table of every enabled provider |
| `hermes quota status --json` | Raw payload for the desktop widget |
| `hermes quota status --json --cached` | The cache as-is — never refreshes (widget poll path) |
| `hermes quota status --max-age N` | Refresh first when the cache is older than N seconds |
| `hermes quota status --version-json` | Installed build stamp (update self-check) |
| `hermes quota refresh` | Force a re-fetch of all providers |
| `hermes quota provider <name>` | One provider, e.g. `hermes quota provider anthropic` |
| `hermes quota <provider-id>` | Shortcut, e.g. `hermes quota grok` |


## How it works

Providers with a CLI or OAuth login (`anthropic`, `openai-codex`, `gemini`, `kimi`)
are read locally. A refresh runs the fetchers and writes
`$HERMES_HOME/quota_cache.json`; the UI only ever reads that file.

The desktop widget polls in two phases, so the configured interval is the real
cadence: every `refreshInterval` seconds it reads the cache with
`hermes quota status --json --cached` (no network, no waiting) and, when that
payload is older than the interval, fires `hermes quota refresh` out-of-band and
redraws when it lands. The sweep itself runs every provider **concurrently**
under a wall-clock budget (`REFRESH_BUDGET_S`, 20s), so one slow or hung endpoint
cannot stretch a poll past its interval — it is recorded as `timeout` and drops
its previous value until a refresh succeeds. The last payload is cached in the widget's storage too, so a
plugin reload or a gateway switch paints immediately instead of waiting on a
backend spawn.

> monetary facts, never converted into a quota percentage.
